Cadence is not a Kubernetes extension. It defines no CRDs, installs no admission webhooks, and does not take over the host cluster's control plane. For this project, **enablement** means starting the Frontend, History, Matching, and Worker roles (and optionally turning on subsystems such as advanced visibility or archival). **Disablement** means stopping those processes or turning the optional subsystem off. The operational model is on [Live cluster enablement and rollback](/docs/tech-review/day-1-installation/enablement-rollback/live-cluster-enablement-rollback).

Public continuous integration exercises in-process server bring-up and tear-down against real datastores, and it runs dedicated profiles with optional features configured on. It does not currently automate a Helm install and uninstall cycle on a live Kubernetes cluster. That path is documented for operators and is validated in staged rollout and operator rehearsal rather than by a public chart-install job.

## What is tested where

| Path | What "enable" / "disable" means in the test | Where it runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host integration suites | Start Cadence service processes in-process against Cassandra, MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite; stop them and tear down the test store | Public [CI Checks](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci-checks.yml) via Compose under [`docker/github_actions/`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/tree/master/docker/github_actions) |
| Advanced visibility profiles | Bring up Elasticsearch v7, OpenSearch 2, or Pinot (plus Kafka where required) and run integration suites with the indexer / visibility path enabled | Same CI workflow; separate Compose files such as [`docker-compose-es7.yml`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/docker/github_actions/docker-compose-es7.yml), [`docker-compose-opensearch2.yml`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/docker/github_actions/docker-compose-opensearch2.yml), and [`docker-compose-pinot.yml`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/docker/github_actions/docker-compose-pinot.yml) |
| History queue v2 profiles | Integration suite with `history.enableTransferQueueV2` and `history.enableTimerQueueV2` set true in dynamic config | Compose services `integration-test-cassandra-queue-v2` and `integration-test-cassandra-queue-v2-alert` set `ENABLE_QUEUE_V2=true` (and `ENABLE_QUEUE_V2_ALERT=true` for the alert job) |
| Archival, scheduler, async workflows | Integration configs turn the Worker subsystems on (filestore archival, `worker.enableScheduler`, Kafka async workflow consumer) and exercise those paths | Host suites under [`host/`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/tree/master/host); async-WF job in CI Checks |
| Dynamic configuration clients | Unit tests load, poll, and override dynamic keys (including enable/disable style bool and string properties) | Golang unit-test job in CI Checks |
| Local contributor Compose | `docker compose -f docker/dev/*.yml up` then `down` for dependency enablement and cleanup | Documented in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md); not a required public CI job |
| Packaged server Compose | `docker compose up` / `down` for full local stacks, including feature overlays (ES, archival, HTTP API, canary, bench) | Documented in the [Docker README](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/docker/README.md); canary and bench are not jobs in public CI Checks |
| Helm chart | `helm install` / `helm delete` (uninstall) of the [cadence-charts](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-charts) release | Documented in the [chart README](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-charts/blob/main/README.md). Public chart CI publishes releases and shellchecks schema scripts; it does **not** run an automated install/uninstall test suite |
| Staged pre-release rollout | Candidate builds are enabled in real clusters (development, staging, production) before a stable GitHub Release | Same staged path described on [Upgrade and rollback testing](/docs/tech-review/day-1-installation/rollout-upgrade-rollback/upgrade-rollback-testing) |

## Public CI: Compose-backed integration enablement

Server [CI Checks](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci-checks.yml) start dependency containers with Docker Compose, run a test container against them, and exit. Typical commands look like:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/github_actions/docker-compose.yml run integration-test-cassandra \
  bash -c "make .just-build && make cover_integration_profile"
```

[`docker/github_actions/docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/docker/github_actions/docker-compose.yml) defines Cassandra, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Kafka, Elasticsearch, and the integration-test services. Separate Compose files swap in Elasticsearch 7, OpenSearch 2, or Pinot for visibility-focused jobs. Those Compose services are ephemeral to the GitHub Actions runner and are discarded when the job ends. That is the project's automated proof that a revision can **enable** Cadence against those backends and stop the in-process services cleanly in teardown.

Inside each suite, enablement is the in-process cluster start in [`host/testcluster.go`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/host/testcluster.go) and [`host/onebox.go`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/host/onebox.go). Disablement of that test cluster is `TearDownCluster()`, which calls `host.Stop()` (Frontend, History, Matching, and any enabled Worker subsystems such as replicator, archiver, or scheduler), closes the dynamic-config client's `doneCh`, tears down the persistence test store, and removes temporary archival directories.

Local reproduction of the same Compose runners is documented under [`docker/github_actions/README.md`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/docker/github_actions/README.md). Contributor dependency-only stacks use `docker/dev/*.yml` with explicit `up` and `down` steps in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

History and replication [simulation workflows](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/tree/master/.github/workflows) also start disposable environments for specific scenarios (including queue v2 history scenarios). They validate subsystem behavior after enablement; they are not a substitute for a Helm lifecycle test.

## Optional subsystem enablement in tests

Optional features are not all on in every suite. Dedicated configs and CI jobs turn them on:

| Subsystem | How the test enables it | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Advanced visibility (Elasticsearch / OpenSearch) | Test cluster YAML sets `workerconfig.enableindexer: true` and an `esconfig`; CI Compose brings up search + Kafka | [`host/testdata/integration_elasticsearch_v7_cluster.yaml`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/host/testdata/integration_elasticsearch_v7_cluster.yaml), [`host/elastic_search_test.go`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/host/elastic_search_test.go), ES7 / OpenSearch CI jobs |
| Advanced visibility (Pinot) | Pinot-specific cluster config and `TestPinotIntegrationSuite` | [`docker-compose-pinot.yml`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/docker/github_actions/docker-compose-pinot.yml), Pinot CI job in CI Checks |
| History queue v2 | Env `ENABLE_QUEUE_V2=true` (read in [`host/integration_test.go`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/host/integration_test.go)) selects [`integration_queuev2_cluster.yaml`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/host/testdata/integration_queuev2_cluster.yaml); alert variant uses `integration_queuev2_with_alert_cluster.yaml` | Queue-v2 Compose services and CI jobs in CI Checks |
| Archival | Default integration cluster YAML sets `enablearchival` / `enablearchiver`; filestore provider under the test archiver base | [`host/testdata/integration_test_cluster.yaml`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/host/testdata/integration_test_cluster.yaml), [`host/archival_test.go`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/host/archival_test.go); local overlay [`docker-compose-archival-filestore.yml`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/docker/docker-compose-archival-filestore.yml) |
| Schedules | Default integration cluster sets `workerconfig.enablescheduler: true`, and dynamic config sets `worker.enableScheduler: true`; suite skips if the worker config leaves the scheduler off | [`host/testdata/integration_test_cluster.yaml`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/host/testdata/integration_test_cluster.yaml), [`host/testdata/dynamicconfig/integration_test.yaml`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/host/testdata/dynamicconfig/integration_test.yaml), [`host/schedule_test.go`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/host/schedule_test.go) |
| Async workflows | Kafka topic env and async-WF integration suite | Async-WF job in CI Checks; Compose service `integration-test-async-wf` |
| Dynamic config plumbing | File-based and in-memory clients: set a key, read the new value, restore defaults | [`common/dynamicconfig/config_test.go`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/common/dynamicconfig/config_test.go), [`file_based_client_test.go`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/common/dynamicconfig/file_based_client_test.go), [`configstore/`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/tree/master/common/dynamicconfig/configstore) |

Those suites prove Cadence can start with the subsystem configured and that the feature path works. They are not a matrix that flips every production dynamic key (`system.writeVisibilityStoreName`, archival domain status, and similar) from on to off inside one CI job. Operators who need that rehearsal should follow the enable and disable steps on [Live cluster enablement and rollback](/docs/tech-review/day-1-installation/enablement-rollback/live-cluster-enablement-rollback) in a non-production cluster, then confirm workers, visibility queries, and archival read paths still match expectations after the change.

## Helm install and uninstall

The chart documents enablement as `helm install` and disablement as `helm delete` (uninstall) in the [cadence-charts README](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-charts/blob/main/README.md). Schema setup runs as a Kubernetes Job before the service Deployments become ready, which matches the operational enablement sequence on the live-cluster page.

Public automation in [cadence-charts `.github/workflows`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-charts/tree/main/.github/workflows) today is:

| Workflow | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [`release.yml`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-charts/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml) | Chart-releaser publish on pushes to `main` |
| [`shellcheck.yml`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-charts/blob/main/.github/workflows/shellcheck.yml) | ShellCheck on schema helper scripts |

There is no public `ct install` / chart-testing job, and no public workflow that installs the chart into a kind or similar cluster and then uninstalls it. Treat Helm enablement and disablement as an **operator rehearsal** (and part of staged rollout of packaged deployments), not as something the public chart CI currently proves on every PR. Leftover objects after uninstall are covered on [Resource cleanup](/docs/tech-review/day-1-installation/enablement-rollback/resource-cleanup).

## Local Compose stacks, canary, and bench

The server [`docker/`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/tree/master/docker) directory ships full-stack Compose files for evaluation and operational testing. `docker compose up` enables a local Cadence (often via the `auto-setup` image). `docker compose down` disables it. Shipped Compose files do not declare named volumes for Cassandra, MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Elasticsearch; image `VOLUME` directories still leave anonymous volumes until `docker compose down -v`, so a plain `down` keeps local datastore data for re-enablement. Feature overlays include advanced visibility, archival filestore, HTTP API, multi-cluster, and custom config. See the [Docker README](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/docker/README.md) and [Resource cleanup](/docs/tech-review/day-1-installation/enablement-rollback/resource-cleanup).

After a local server is up, [`docker-compose-canary.yml`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/docker/docker-compose-canary.yml) and [`docker-compose-bench.yml`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/docker/docker-compose-bench.yml) start canary and load-test workers. Those Compose files are for local or deployed health and capacity checks. They are **not** steps in the public CI Checks workflow. Validation expectations for canary and bench after an install are on [Validation](/docs/tech-review/day-0-planning/installation/validation).

## Operator rehearsal for enablement and disablement

Use the same honesty threshold as [Upgrade and rollback testing](/docs/tech-review/day-1-installation/rollout-upgrade-rollback/upgrade-rollback-testing): public CI covers a revision against project-maintained Compose backends; your production package, values, and adjacent services may differ.

A practical rehearsal for enablement and disablement:

1. **Enable** Cadence with the deployment path you run in production (Helm values, Compose overlay, or binaries), including any optional subsystem you rely on.
2. Register a domain, start a worker, and complete a representative workflow (see [Validation](/docs/tech-review/day-0-planning/installation/validation)).
3. **Disable** by scaling roles to zero, `helm uninstall` / `helm delete`, or `docker compose down` without destroying the datastore you intend to keep.
4. Confirm the host Kubernetes cluster (if any) is unaffected, and that workflow data remains in the datastore when you chose a non-destructive disable.
5. **Re-enable** against the same datastore and `numHistoryShards`, then confirm open and new workflows progress again.

Version upgrade and binary rollback are a separate question from process enablement. See [Upgrade and rollback testing](/docs/tech-review/day-1-installation/rollout-upgrade-rollback/upgrade-rollback-testing) and [Rollback procedures](/docs/tech-review/day-1-installation/rollout-upgrade-rollback/rollback-procedures).
